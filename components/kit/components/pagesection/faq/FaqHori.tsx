              Running existing machine learning projects in Valohai is very simple! Integration only requires adding a
              valohai.yaml configuration file. Moving projects in and out of Valohai is easy – the integration is only
              the configuration file.

              We don’t. Valohai isn’t a data science platform; it's a Machine Learning Management Platform that handles
              the whole ML pipeline from feature extraction, to training of your model and to deploying it into
              production in a reproducible manner. Data science platforms offer hosted notebooks and AutoML solutions.

              Depends. Most of our customers use their own cloud and thus pay for usage according to their own
              agreements. Valohai doesn't charge anything on top of the per-user license fee. If you don't have a cloud
              provider, you can use our AWS, GCP and Azure accounts, and we'll only charge you for what you use.
